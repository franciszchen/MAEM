    "final_diagnostic_result": "```\nThe patient is diagnosed with a chronic autoimmune disorder, specifically Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). This diagnosis is supported by the presence of multiple symptoms, including fatigue, joint pain, skin rashes, and recurrent fevers. The patient's serological tests have also revealed the presence of antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibodies, which are characteristic of SLE.",
    "final_tcurrent_service": "```\nGiven the complexity of the patient's condition, it is recommended that they receive comprehensive care through a multidisciplinary team, including rheumatologists, dermatologists, and hematologists. The current service plan includes:\n\n1. **Rheumatology Consultation:** The patient will be referred to a rheumatologist for further evaluation and management of their SLE. This will involve regular monitoring of disease activity, prescription of appropriate immunosuppressive medications, and close follow-up to assess treatment response.\n\n2. **Dermatology Consultation:** Given the skin rashes observed, the patient will also be referred to a dermatologist for evaluation and management of any skin manifestations related to their SLE. This may involve the use of topical or systemic medications, as well as monitoring for any potential complications.\n\n3. **Hematology Consultation:** As SLE can affect the blood system, the patient will be referred to a hematologist for regular monitoring of their blood counts and evaluation of any potential hematological complications. This may involve the need for blood transfusions or other supportive measures.\n\n4. **Psychological Support:** Given the significant impact of chronic illness on mental health, the patient will be referred to a psychologist or psychiatrist for assessment and management of any psychological distress related to their diagnosis and treatment.\n\n5. **Nutritional Counseling:** A registered dietitian will provide guidance on a balanced diet that supports the patient's overall health and helps manage their SLE symptoms.\n\n6. **Physical Therapy:** To manage joint pain and maintain mobility, the patient will undergo a physical therapy regimen tailored to their specific needs.\n\n7. **Patient Education:** The patient and their family will receive comprehensive education on SLE, its management, and potential complications. This will include information on medication adherence, lifestyle modifications, and signs of disease flare-ups.\n\n8. **Follow-up Appointments:** Regular follow-up appointments will be scheduled with the multidisciplinary team to monitor disease progression, assess treatment efficacy, and make necessary adjustments to the care plan.\n\nIn conclusion, the final summary of the patient's diagnosis and current service plan involves a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach to managing their chronic autoimmune disorder, Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). This plan addresses the various aspects of the patient's health, including medical, psychological, nutritional, and physical well-being, and ensures that they receive the best possible care for their condition."
